WARNING: [Power 33-332] Found switching activity that implies high-fanout reset nets being asserted for excessive periods of time which may result in inaccurate power analysis.
Resolution: To review and fix problems, please run Power Constraints Advisor in the GUI from Tools > Power Constraints Advisor or run report_power with the -advisory option to generate a text report.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Top_i/RESPUESTA_SERIAL/inst/o_Response_reg[31]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Top_i/RESPUESTA_SERIAL/inst/o_Response_reg[31]_i_2/O, cell Top_i/RESPUESTA_SERIAL/inst/o_Response_reg[31]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
